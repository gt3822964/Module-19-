# Module-19-

I changed the name of the file from Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb to Crypto_Clustering.ipynb. I made the data normal by using StandardScaler() from scikit-learn on the CSV file data. I looked for the best k value with the scaled data as it was at first. Then, I grouped the cryptocurrencies using K-means with the scaled data. I made the clustering better using Principal Component Analysis. Found the best k value with the PCA data. After that, I grouped the cryptocurrencies again using K-means, but this time with the PCA data.
